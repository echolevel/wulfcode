# Wulfcode 0.2 config file

# MIDI device setup: to get the right numbers, run Wulfcode and do 'mididevice list'. You'll see a number for each input and output found on your system.
# If you need to change midi devices while Wulfcode is running, use e.g. 'mididevice 4 6' where 4 is an input port number and 6 is an output port number.

midioutdevice=2

# MIDI clock type
# Some DAWs (possibly only Renoise?) emit a constant MIDI clock pulse, even when transport is stopped. This is a bit weird. For most other DAWs (e.g. Ableton
# Live), keep this set to false; otherwise set it to true. If enabled, Wulfcode won't start running sequences until it receives a 'start' command, and will stop
# when it gets a 'stop'. Also, 'start' commands will reset all sequence positions to zero so that they're synchronised.
